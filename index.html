                    <h1>Barcelona Foundation</h1>
                    <p>FC Barcelona, founded in 1899 by a group of young foreigners living in Barcelona, was the result
                        of the increasing popularity of football, and other British sports, across Europe.
                        </br> </br>
                        These origins
                        have conferred upon the Club its intercultural identity, multi-sport focus and its deeply-rooted
                        allegiance to Barcelona and Catalonia. The foundation of the Club coincided with a time when
                        people were becoming interested in playing sport in Catalonia; this social context and
                        Catalonia’s idiosyncratic culture led to the creation of a new model of modern leisure. Gamper,
                        the Club’s founder, was the inspiration and
                        driving force behind the Club’s first 25 years.
                        His commitment to FC Barcelona went far beyond
                        his role as player, director and president.</p>

                    <h1>1969-78. Cruyff and democracy</h1>
                    <p>
                        To put an end once and for all to the Club’s ill fate, a star player was needed to arouse
                        interest amongst fans. The chosen one was Johan Cruyff, the Dutch forward who had triumphed
                        throughout Europe with AFC Ajax of Amsterdam: Cruyff, at that time was considered the best
                        player in the world.</br></br>
                        On 13 August 1973, Cruyff joined Barça. He became the leader of a talented
                        team, managed by Rinus Michels, which brought the Camp Nou back to its former glory. Cruyff
                        demonstrated an intelligent style of play and superb technique.
                        During the presidency of Agustí Montal i Costa, FC Barcelona implemented a policy for the Club
                        to strengthen its Catalan identity, despite the limits imposed by the Francoist dictatorship. In
                        1972, the Catalan language was once more emitted through the loudspeakers at the Camp Nou and
                        the Club newsletter (which boasted important figures amongst the Catalan intelligentsia as
                        contributors) began to use Catalan. In 1973, the Club reinstated its original name: Futbol Club
                        Barcelona. In 1975 Catalan was restored to its place as the Club's official language. That same
                        year, FC Barcelona joined the Congress for Catalan Culture.

                    <p>
                        “I know the Club and I don’t want history to repeat itself. If we want things to change, we must
                        change history”. These words set the Cruyff era in motion, marked by a change of philosophy. The
                        team’s tactics were modified to incorporate the Dutch coach Rinus Michels’s “total football”.
                        Team management also changed, becoming the exclusive responsibility of the manager. With Cruyff,
                        Barça experienced a glorious era.
                        </br> </br>
                        Cruyff’s track record includes one European Cup, four Spanish
                        League championships, one Cup Winners’ Cup, one Copa del Rey and four Spanish Supercups. He was
                        also responsible for introducing “rondos” (a circle of players pass the ball to each other,
                        while one in the centre tries to catch it) into the team’s training sessions.

                        This team was the culmination of everything that FC Barcelona stands for, and produced an
                        amazing string of major titles, including two Champions Leagues and three Spanish Leagues, plus
                        the long-awaited Clubs World Cup, which was finally won in 2009, that extraordinary year when
                        Barcelona won all six major trophies, something unprecedented in the history of European
                        football.

                        </br>
                        Barça broke all kinds of records, played memorable matches and won just about every title on
                        offer. But the finest hour for Guardiola's side came at Wembley on 28 May, 2011, when the world
                        was enchanted by the kind of football that dreams are made of. The world's press bestowed praise
                        on this extraordinary side that had written one of the most incredible chapters in the history
                        of the game.

                        </br>
                        The Guardiola era ended in 2012 but Barça continued their success under Tito Vilanova (the
                        league in 2012/13) and Luis Enrique who in 2015 won the Champions League, the League and the
                        Copa del Rey in another historic treble winning season.

                <p>Messi (Rosario, Argentina, 24 June 1987) is the greatest player of all time and FC Barcelona record
                    setter. Trained at La Masia, he will always be associated with Barça as the greatest player ever to
                    wear the blaugrana shirt</p>
                <p>Leo Messi's footballing career started in 1995 at Newell's Old Boys, where he played until the year
                    2000. At the age of 13, Lionel Messi crossed the Atlantic to try his luck in Barcelona, and joined
                    the Under 14s. Messi made spectacular progress at each of the different age levels, climbing through
                    the ranks to Barça C, followed by Barça B and the first team in record time.</p>
                <p>In the 2003-2004 season, when he was still only 16, Messi made his first team debut in a friendly
                    with Porto that marked the opening of the new Do Dragao stadium.


                    The following championship-winning season, Messi made his first appearance in an official match on
                    October 16, 2004, in Barcelona's derby win against Espanyol at the Olympic Stadium (0-1). </p>
                <p>Messi’s individual achievements are also unprecedented: six Ballon d’Or awards, six times Champions
                    League top scorer, six times Golden Shoe winner, eight times ‘Pichichi’ (top scorer) in La Liga,
                    Ballon d’Or winner at the 2014 World Cup, FIFA World Player of the Year in 2009 and FIFA The Best
                    winner in 2019. </p>

                <p>On an individual level Messi began to set records as a youngster and never looked back. The Argentine
                    has made more appearances than anyone, 778, scored more goals, 672, provided most assists, 305 and
